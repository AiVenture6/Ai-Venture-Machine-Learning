# AI-Based Travel Recommendation Application

This project is an AI-powered travel recommendation application designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. Leveraging the power of machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), the application analyzes user input and offers tailored travel suggestions.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides travel suggestions based on user preferences.
- **Support Vector Machine Model**: Employs SVM for high accuracy and robust predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered user preference data for training and testing.
2. **Model Training**: Built and trained an SVM model for recommendation tasks.
3. **Prediction**: Based on user input, the model predicts and suggests the most relevant travel destinations.
